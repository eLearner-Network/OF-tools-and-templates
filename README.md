## Tools and templates for OpenFrameworks

This repository contains a series of “tools” and “templates” for my projects involving OpenFrameworks. Tools and templates are analogous to [addons](http://www.ofxaddons.com) and examples in OF.

Tools contain classes for generating visual and audio content, organizing and handling parameters and interfaces, creating GUIs, communicating and interactivity with peripherals and other applications, etc. Like addons, they can be included with any OF project — the difference is that tools are higher-level and so less general than addons, being mostly specific to routines in my own work. 

Templates are to tools as examples are to addons. They are complete OF projects which demo tools in simple ways. 

This repo is incomplete at the moment, and will be updated regularly as I add more to it.


### Usage

To use these in an OF project, the best place to put this repo is in your OF root folder, so that “tools” and “templates” are the same level from your root folder as addons and included examples.

Many of the tools and templates require some addons to function. An incomplete list, to be updated later when more content is up here.
