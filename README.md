## Tools and templates for OpenFrameworks

This repository contains a series of “tools” and “templates” for my projects involving OpenFrameworks. Tools and templates are analogous to [addons](http://www.ofxaddons.com) and examples in OF parlance.

Tools contain a variety of classes for doing useful things, like generating visual and audio content, organizing and handling parameters, and control systems, generating GUIs, communication with other applications, interactivity with peripherals, etc. Like addons, they can be included with any OF project — the difference between these and addons is that tools are higher-level and less general than addons, being mostly specific to common routines in my own work, and less useful as generalized tools for ofxAddons. 

Templates are to tools as examples are to addons. They are complete OF projects which make use of the tools. 

This repository is incomplete at the moment, and will be updated regularly as I add more to it.


### Usage

To use these in an OF project, the best place to put this repo is in your OF folder, so that “tools” and “templates” are the same level from your root folder as addons and examples. Then any template project can be opened and run.

Many of the tools and templates require some addons to function. An incomplete list, to be updated later when more content is up here.
