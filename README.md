### Tools and templates for OpenFrameworks

This repository contains a series of “tools” and “templates” for my projects involving [OpenFrameworks](openframeworks.cc). Tools and templates are analogous to [addons](http://www.ofxaddons.com) and examples in OF.

Tools contain classes for generating visual and audio content, organizing and handling parameters and interfaces, creating GUIs, communicating and interactivity with peripherals and other applications, etc. Like addons, they can be included with any OF project — the difference is that tools are higher-level and so less general than addons, being mostly specific to routines in my own work. 

Templates are to tools as examples are to addons. They are complete OF projects which demo the tools in simple ways. 


#### License

Everything in this repository is licensed [GNU General Public License v3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).


#### Usage

To use these in an OF project, the best place to put this repo is in your OF root folder, so that it is at the same level from your root folder as addons.

Many of the tools and templates require additional addons to function. This is a complete list of addons used in any of the templates, though not all templates require all addons.
