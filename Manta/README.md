### Manta

This is a class that interfaces with the [Manta](http://www.snyderphonics.com/products.htm), a touch-sensitive controller made by [Jeff Snyder](http://www.scattershot.org/).  The base addon is [ofxManta](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxManta). The code here integrates the addon with the rest of the toolkit, as well as providing additional analytical tools and statistical tracking (useful for [Learn](https://github.com/genekogan/OF-tools-and-templates/tree/master/Learn/template-manta)).
