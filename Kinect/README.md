### Kinect

Routines wrapping functionality from ofxKinect, [ofxKinectProjectorToolkit](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxKinectProjectorToolkit), and [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv). For the old Kinect (V1) only.

 - tracking and masking contours/blobs
 - tracking keypoints
 - mapping kinect contours according to a [kinect-projector calibration file](genekogan.com/works/kinect-projector-toolkit.html)

Most of this module is duplicated and improved by the related [OpenNi tool](https://github.com/genekogan/OF-tools-and-templates/tree/master/OpenNi) which is based on ofxOpenNi, and should eventually replace this tool.
