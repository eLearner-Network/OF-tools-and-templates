### Algorithms

#### Point generator

 - Evenly-distributed sample points in 2d [link](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/#sampling)
 - Circle-packing 
 - Triangulation (based on Delaunay)


#### Subdivision

Recursively subdivide a 2d polygon. There is a bug that is causing some polygons to overlap.


#### Time Function

This is a class which combines time-based behaviors (line, oscillation, perlin noise) and applies them to floats, ints, ofVec2f/3f/4f.
