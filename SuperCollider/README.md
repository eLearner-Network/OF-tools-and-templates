### SuperCollider

This class uses [ofxSuperCollider](www.erase.net/projects/ofxSuperCollider/) to communicate with [SuperCollider](supercollider.sourceforge.net).

It can create and sequence a set of SynthDefs and deploy them from OF.

Additionally, it can automatically generate synth defs by parsing an .scd file with metadata about the parameters and their ranges. The file `synths.scd` contains an example set of SynthDefs.
